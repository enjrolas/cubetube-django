<p>The four demos will loop forever by default.

(If you don&rsquo;t have a phone that can download apps, you can still get your Cube online, it&rsquo;s just a little more involved of a process to <a href='http://docs.spark.io/connect/#connecting-your-core-connect-over-usb'/>Connect over USB</a>)</li></ul>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>4.&nbsp; Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the Spark Core app from the App Store or Google Play, create an account.&nbsp; <b>This will also be the account you use for CubeTube.org</b>.&nbsp; Afterwards, you&rsquo;ll be asked to connect your Core (which will thereby connect your Cube to your WiFi router).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Note: Your phone must be connected to the&nbsp; Wi-Fi network that you want to connect the Core to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>5.&nbsp; When connected to Wi-Fi, the app will automatically fill in the SSID field with the name of the network that your phone is connected to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter your Wi-Fi password and hit connect.</li></ul>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>This connection process can take up to a minute. The closer your phone is to your Spark Core, the faster it will connect. Once the Core hears the signal, it will go through the following sequence of lights:</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Solid blue</b>: Credentials captured</li>
<li><b>Flashing green</b>: Connecting to Wi-Fi network</li>
<li><b>Flashing cyan</b>: Connecting to Spark Cloud</li>
<li><b>Breathing cyan</b>: Connected to Spark Cloud</li></ul>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Once the Spark Core has connected, you&rsquo;ll be asked to name your Core (and thereby also name your Cube).</li></ul>

<p><i>NOTE: The Core <b>MUST</i></b><i> be online (breathing cyan)&nbsp; in order for the claiming process to work. If the Spark Core has been claimed by someone else, the app won&rsquo;t recognize it.</i></p><p></p><p>If you are connecting multiple Cores, you&rsquo;ll go through this naming&nbsp; process for each Core. You&rsquo;ll know which one is which by the rainbow signal.</p><p></p><p>Now your Cube is online!</p><p></p><p><u>Switching to New WiFi Locations</u></p><p>When you move to a new WiFi locations, you can get your Cube&rsquo;s Spark Core back into Listening Mode by clicking the big round &quot;Connect to WiFi&quot; button on the underside of the Cube.&nbsp; This will not delete any programs you have stored in the internal memory of the Spark Core, and just clears the WiFi credentials and puts the Spark Core back into WiFi Listening Mode.&nbsp; Remember, you&rsquo;ll also need to switch your Cube into Online mode.&nbsp; Then repeat the process above to connect to the new WiFi location.</p><p></p><p><b><u>CUBETUBE: THE VOLUMETRIC WONDERLAND</u></b></p><p><u>Loading CubeTube Apps onto Your Cube</u></p><p>When you first go to CubeTube.org, click the &quot;Join or Log in&quot;

If you chose a &quot;Cube Required&quot; app, immediately after you click the Send to Cube button, the LED on the Spark Core under your Cube should start to blink purple (indicating it is downloading the app).&nbsp; This download process will take 10-45 seconds.</p><p></p><p>If you chose a &quot;Cube + Computer Required&quot; app for the first time, the L3D library will be sent to your Cube and the LED on the Spark Core under your Cube should start to blink purple (indicating it is downloading the L3D library).&nbsp;

your Cube to WiFi via the Spark App is the easiest way to get your Cube&nbsp; online.&nbsp; But it doesn&rsquo;t work well with all routers.&nbsp; As an easy first step, make sure your Cube is responding as expected by answering these questions:</p><p></p><ul><li>Is your the slider switch at the backside of your Cube switched to Online mode?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>When you connect your Cube to power, does the LED on the Spark Core on the underside of your Cube turn on?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Is that LED under your Cube blinking blue?</li></ul>

<p>If you answered yes to these questions and you are still having trouble connecting your Cube to WiFi via the Spark App, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll get you online!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>First,&nbsp; if you are technically inclined, try to claim a Core over USB via the <a href='https://github.com/spark/spark-cli'/>Spark Command Line Interface</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work out, contact Alex and Shawn at&nbsp; info@lookingglassfactory.com for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>And worst case scenario,&nbsp; replacement Photons ship in late June, which will likely resolve&nbsp; all connectivity issues.</p><p></p><p><u>Factory Reset of Your Cube</u></p><p>Sometimes if all else fails, you&rsquo;ll want to perform a factory reset of your Cube.&nbsp; This will delete any programs stored on your Cube and generally will let you start from a clean slate.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s how you to do a factory reset on the Spark Cores in the base of your Cube:</p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/121215141"></a>https://vimeo.com/121215141</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></body>
